Description: Colour choice in information visualisation is important in order to
    avoid being mislead by inherent bias in the used colour palette. The 'scico'
    package provides access to the perceptually
    uniform and colour-blindness friendly palettes developed by Fabio Crameri
    and released under the "Scientific Colour-Maps" moniker. The package
    contains 17 different palettes and includes both diverging and sequential
    types.
