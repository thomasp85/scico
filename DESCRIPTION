Description: Colour choice in information visualisation is important in order to
    avoid being mislead by inherent bias in the used colour palette. The 'scico'
    package provides access to the perceptually uniform and colour-blindness 
    friendly palettes developed by Fabio Crameri and released under the 
    "Scientific Colour-Maps" moniker. The package contains 24 different palettes 
    and includes both diverging and sequential types.
